"If I want something accomplished, I can and I should." These words were more than just a motto for my father—they were the embodiment of his spirit and the foundation upon which he built his life. As a dedicated small business owner, my father demonstrated daily how determination and hard work could transform aspirations into reality. Some of my earliest and most cherished memories are of sitting beside him as he carefully balanced his business ledger. Watching him turn numbers into stories of perseverance and success sparked a fascination within me—a fascination that would quietly grow into a passion for accounting and finance.

When my father unexpectedly passed away during my college years, my world was turned upside down. The grief was overwhelming, and the sudden responsibility of supporting my family felt daunting. Balancing these emotional and financial burdens took a toll on my academic performance, and my grades suffered despite my best efforts. Yet, in those challenging times, it was my father's unwavering belief in perseverance that kept me moving forward. I reminded myself that honoring his legacy meant not giving up, even when the odds were stacked against me.

Determined to prove myself and reignite my academic journey, I enrolled in the Master of Quantitative Econometrics program at the University of Texas. I chose this program because I believed it would equip me with the tools necessary for pursuing a PhD in accounting. The program’s rigorous curriculum prepared me well for further studies, and my GPA and GRE score reflect the commitment and hard work I put into mastering its challenges. Through courses like Probability (R), I gained a solid foundation in statistical analysis and the practical application of probability theory. The Data Mining (Python) course equipped me with valuable skills in machine learning and data interpretation, allowing me to uncover meaningful insights from complex datasets. In Econometric and Causal Inference (Stata), I learned to construct and analyze sophisticated econometric models, skills I am currently applying to a research project examining the impact of remote work trends on capital markets. 

My professional experiences have further shaped my understanding and appreciation of the intricate world of accounting. At Deloitte, and later as an Investment Director at a U.S. dollar fund, I had the privilege of working on large-scale, cross-regional projects that exposed me to the multifaceted nature of global financial markets. From facilitating the acquisition of a gold mine in Russia to analyzing equity investments in major corporations, I witnessed firsthand how data and human judgment intertwine in critical decision-making processes.

These experiences sparked a profound curiosity within me about the subtle influences that shape financial decisions. I found myself pondering how factors such as education, culture, and personal experience impact the perspectives and analyses of financial analysts, ultimately influencing market behaviors and outcomes. This line of questioning has evolved into a passionate research interest that I am eager to explore further.

Pursuing a PhD in accounting is, for me, a natural and deeply meaningful next step. I am driven by a desire to contribute to the academic community by exploring the intersection of quantitative analysis and human factors in financial decision-making. I believe that understanding these dynamics can lead to more informed and effective financial practices, benefiting industries and economies alike.
Beyond research, I am also passionate about education and mentorship. My time as a Research Assistant has shown me the joy and fulfillment that comes from sharing knowledge and fostering intellectual growth in others. I am excited about the prospect of teaching and inspiring students, just as my mentors have inspired me.

I approach this next chapter with a profound sense of purpose and gratitude. The lessons my father imparted—about resilience, hard work, and the relentless pursuit of one's goals—have been my guiding light through life's challenges and achievements. I am committed to honoring his legacy by dedicating myself fully to my studies and contributing meaningfully to the field of accounting.
