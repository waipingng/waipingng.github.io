<br>
<p>I am an investment professional with experience at Deloitte and as an Investment Director at a U.S. dollar fund.</p> 
  
<p>My work across Dallas, Hong Kong, and Shanghai gave me insight into how data and human judgment shape financial decisions, sparking my interest in the intersection of accounting and markets.</p>

<p>My goal is to become a researcher and educator who uses data-driven insights to improve financial decision-making and empower future generations.</p>

<p><strong>But I am only getting started.</strong></p>
